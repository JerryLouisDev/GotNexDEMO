# GotNexDEMO

Hey Everyone Welcomee to GotNEX, every outdoor hoopers dream! Now I know your wondering 'how is this every outdoor hoopers DREAM?'. 

To answer that question i'd tell you a little story about me. I was born and raised in Boston, MA and as a kid my parents worked hard to have a roof over our heads.
 
This cause me as a kid all the way to a young adult played basketball at the park with my friends, but we never knew where people were playing basketball.

I remember one day I said to my friend, 'there needs to be a app for this like facebook or something ANYTHING'. Moving into the future HERE WE ARE!! 

I have created an application that people can signup/login and checkin to the park they are at! With this other users can see how popular the courts are in live time !!

This App is great for people who want to play basketball but just dont know where people are playing, and my question to you is...

Who GotNex?!
